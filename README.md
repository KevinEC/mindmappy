## How to use
As a prototype Mappy isn't all that intuitive yet - and can sometimes be buggy - therefore a short how-to is required.

### Opening the menu 
*External mouse is required*
Interaction in Mappy revolves around the middle mouse click. Pressing and holding down the middle mouse button ( the scroll wheel ) will open the interaction menu. Menu options are selected by releasing the mouse button over the desired menu option.

### Creating a new Topic
Creating topics is done by opening the menu on a blank space and dragging the mouse to the right and selcting the menu option by releasing the middle mouse button.
